# Infer metabolic momentum from moment differences of mass-weighted intensity distributions

I am introducing this work in YouTube, if you are interested, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/@Iobiomathematics. These works have been publically deposited in this Github since one year ago (I hidden some previous versions after updated new versions). If you are interested, feel free to contact tl@biomathematics.org, for more materials available by request.
